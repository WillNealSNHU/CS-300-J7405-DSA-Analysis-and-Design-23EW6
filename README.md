•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? – I was attempting to open, load, and parse a data file. Once this was done I was trying to then use that data to open up and display in various ways, whether sorted or searched for. The take away was different reference type data structures have different run times. 

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. – I believe data structures are important to understand because different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses. I could replace data structures with the example of saw’s. A bandsaw is still a saw that cuts wood and a reciprocating saw also does the same. However these saws have different applications depending on the need of the wood and project. It is no different here. Maybe we know we will need to sort the data but not add or delete anything from it. Maybe we know the there are going to be many revisions to the data so adding and deleting are important. You pick the right tool for the job. 


•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? – I found resources, fortunately this class has an amazing set up on BrightSpace with plenty of resources and tools to understand the reference types/data structures fully. 

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? – I am definitely more familiar with data types I was not in the past. Hash Tables are not something I would have used much in my job. I have been coding for 3+ years professionally. So this was exposure to new things.


•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? – I think most importantly is adaptable. If I throw all my data into a vector and call it a day then later down the road map that data is shifting a vector is probably not going to cut it. Especially if the data is going to be changing on a regular basis.
